/**
 * `logistic-v2` — moderate-volume successor to `logistic-v1`.
 *
 * What changed and why (v1 prescribed 105–239% of the predicted max per
 * session and single sets up to 105% — too much, too hard):
 * - Every session is built from that day's **predicted max** and lands at
 *   ~140–160% of it, split into 4 sets. No difficulty multiplier.
 * - The first session of each week is the one heavier day: top set capped at
 *   85% of predicted max (floor-rounded so the cap really holds), the rest
 *   easy. Other days are ~4 × 40% with a slight wave, alternating between two
 *   patterns.
 * - No AMRAP outside tests — every non-test set is a fixed target.
 * - The predicted-max curve is a **Gompertz** sigmoid from startMax to
 *   targetMax, normalized to pass exactly through both endpoints. Gompertz
 *   instead of a symmetric logistic because gains aren't symmetric: they come
 *   fast early (neural adaptation, form efficiency) and then grind slowly
 *   toward the ceiling. The inflection sits at ~35% of the span rather than
 *   50%, so the steep phase lands in the first half and the back half is a
 *   long, realistic approach — a symmetric logistic instead claims the
 *   biggest jumps mid-plan, where there's no mechanism for them.
 * - Calibration **re-anchors**: after a test, the future is a fresh Gompertz
 *   from the test result to targetMax over the remaining sessions — no decay
 *   back to the old trajectory. Anchoring is piecewise per test, so sessions
 *   before a later test keep the curve they were generated from. A result at
 *   or above targetMax holds the curve flat at that result. The early-
 *   inflection shape composes well with re-anchoring: each segment pushes in
 *   the fresh weeks right after a test + recovery and eases as the next test
 *   approaches — a built-in mini-taper. (A symmetric curve would restart slow
 *   after every test and shove the steepness ever later.)
 * - The plan **opens with a max test** (session 1, predicted = startMax):
 *   measure the real max first, then train from it — logging it re-anchors
 *   the whole curve immediately. A recovery session follows, as after any
 *   other test.
 * - Mid-plan test cadence, taper (×0.6) and recovery (×0.85) days are
 *   unchanged from v1; taper/recovery always use the easy shape, never the
 *   heavy set.
 *
 * Every session carries `predictedMax` so the UI can print and plot the curve.
 *
 * The id keeps the historical `logistic-v2` name — ids are opaque and stable,
 * and this one shipped in the store migration before the curve became Gompertz.
