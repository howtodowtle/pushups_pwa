      </h1>

      <h2>The idea</h2>
      <p>
        Pick an exercise, enter your current max and a target, and the app generates a
        progressive training plan — a few sessions per week, each a handful of sets. Follow the
        plan and the numbers grow.
      </p>

      <h2>Day to day</h2>
      <p>
        Your session lives on the Today card. Tap each set as you do it — one in the morning,
        the rest whenever — or hit <strong>Log all sets</strong> to check the whole session off
        at once. Tapping a checked set undoes it; the session completes when the last set is
        logged. Sets marked <strong>min</strong> and test sessions ask what you actually got —
        test results recalibrate the rest of the plan. Missed a day? The schedule shifts
        forward. Started a session but didn't finish? It closes overnight with the sets you
        did — the rest count as 0 — and the plan moves on.
      </p>

      <h2>Make it yours</h2>
      <p>
        Tap any upcoming session to edit its sets. Add your own exercises (anything counted in
        reps or seconds) and tweak plan parameters in Settings.
      </p>

      <h2>Your data</h2>
      <p>
        Everything is stored in your browser on this device — no account, no server, works
        offline. Export a backup in Settings now and then: clearing browser data also clears
        your training history.
      </p>

      <h2>Install</h2>
      <p>
        Add this page to your home screen (<strong>Add to Home Screen</strong> in the share
        menu, or <strong>Install</strong>) to get a full-screen app.
